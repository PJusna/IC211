The IC211 Lab06 is based on a an overatching parent class name Moving Dot. It holds the basic information 
needed for any given dot that an object oriented programmer could want to implement. It holds the base constructor, 
the step function for moving a dot, and the turn functions. Additional dots need to simple extend the MovingDot and 
implementing their of version of Turning in the Turn method and color in the toString method.

Polymorphism is implemented in the toString returns of the colored dot classes. Their to string returns are polymorphic
in returning unique characters to the Lab06.java file.
